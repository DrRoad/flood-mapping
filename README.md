## Problem Statement 1

### Proposed By - Prof Neena Goveas

You've got a map of a city and you want to make a digital version of it. Imagine drawing lines for streets and marking where they meet as dots. These dots are like intersections or junctions, where roads cross. The lines between these dots represent the roads themselves.

Now, you want to add something extra to this map: water levels on each road. Imagine it's raining. and some roads might flood with water. You need a way to record how deep the water gets on each road

To make things easier, use your own data source (mock data or open source)

Once we have the water levels, we want to see this on our map. We could make something like Google Maps to show our map with the water levels marked on each road.

But what if we don't have data for every road? Well, we can estimate the missing water levels by looking at the water levels of nearby roads and taking an average. This way, even if we don't have data for every single road, we can still have a good idea of how flooded the area might be.
